            Hi there, 
            <br /><br />
            I’m Andrew. I am a Hong Kong UK immigrant who came to the UK at the age of 13 in 2009. 

            <br /><br />
            My life in the UK has been too good to be true and also full of challenges and tears. 
            I did not speak the right English pronunciation 
            nor was I able to communicate fluently with other people when I first started living in the UK for many years.
            
            <br /><br />
            The mission of these programmes is not solely for financial gains. 
            They are the unique skill sets that I want to share with you 
            because I don’t want you to struggle in life just like I did.
            
            <br /><br />
            I share your present pain and suffering. 
            I want you to live a life that is worth living instead of letting time pass by simply
            because you are not equipped with the knowledge and skills 
            that would enable you to achieve and live the life you aspire and deserve.
            
            <br /><br />
            I developed these programmes with all of my heart. 
            I treat these courses as the life-long goal that must be excelled 
            and I want you to gain the same skill sets with me in a much shorter time frame.
            
            <br /><br />
            I hope you will find my courses practical and of use.
            
            <br /><br />
            I also sincerely wish that you will achieve more than me.
            
            <br /><br />
            Regards,<br /><br />
